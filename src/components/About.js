            <p>I'm an aspiring full stack web developer.
            I began learning to code in fall of 2016 while working as a high school
            science and social studies teacher. I quickly realized that coding
            was awesome and approachable, and
            began considering it as a career. Since beginning a few months ago, I have learned
            HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, and have additional practice using JQuery, React, and several other libraries.
            Next I intend to learn Node.js, Express, and MongoDB,
            then build apps using the MERN stack. </p>

            <p>Before learning to code, I earned an M.S. in Geography,
            worked as a researcher, and as a teacher at both the college and
            high school levels. I'm a <a target = "_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"

            published author</a>, experienced data analyst and visualizer, and excellent
            teacher or trainer.</p>

            <p>I live in Round Rock, Texas with my fiance,
            <a target= "_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href= "https://twitter.com/HarridiseLost"> Ben</a>,
            our dog, Zelda, and our silkie chickens.
            When I'm not coding, I enjoy <a target = "_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
